# Superhero Card App

The Superhero Card App is a mobile application that showcases a list of heroes/cartoon characters in a horizontal format using the Carousel package from pub.dev.
The app features a horizontal list of cards, each displaying a different hero/character image. The Carousel package allows the list to slide horizontally on its own, giving the user a seamless and fluid browsing experience. When a user taps on a card, the app displays a preview screen, showcasing more information about the selected hero/character.

One of the unique features of the app is the smooth and fluid transition when a user taps on a card. When a user selects a hero/character from the list, the selected image smoothly zooms into the preview screen, providing an immersive and engaging experience for the user.

Overall, this app is a great example of how Flutter can be used to create visually appealing and interactive mobile applications that can run on multiple platforms.
